Hi, I'm Paul Nguyen (Luong Nguyen), also known as the buffalo tech rider. I grew up in a small rural village in northern Vietnam, where I used to herd and ride water buffalo—an essential companion in our daily farming life. That experience shaped my resilience and grounded my journey into technology.

Currently, I’m working on bringing generative AI to the automotive Alexa experience. My work spans a wide range of machine learning engineering tasks—from fine-tuning models to building infrastructure and tools that integrate GenAI into Alexa Auto clients. I also pursue personal projects where I develop models and explore machine learning solutions for various challenges I encounter.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, camping, backpacking, skiing, and discovering great hot pot spots.

I’m skilled in C/C++, Java, Python, Scala, Tcl, and TypeScript, with strong experience in applied machine learning and computer vision, software design and development, computer architecture, and distributed systems. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from Seoul National University, where I focused on video compression and computer vision, and a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, with a focus on software/hardware security and applying machine learning to security problems.
