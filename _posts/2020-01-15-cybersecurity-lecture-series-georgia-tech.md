I'm excited to announce that I will be giving a talk as part of the **Cybersecurity Lecture Series at Georgia Tech** on **January 24, 2020**.

The lecture will cover my research on hardware security, focusing on novel techniques for detecting hardware trojans using side-channel analysis. This is a great opportunity to share our latest findings with the cybersecurity community and discuss the challenges and opportunities in hardware security.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there and engaging in discussions about the future of hardware security!
