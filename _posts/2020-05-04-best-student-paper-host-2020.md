I'm excited to share that our paper "A Novel Golden-Chip-Free Clustering Technique Using Backscattering Side Channel for Hardware Trojan Detection" won the **Best Student Paper Award** at the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST).

This work presents an innovative approach to detecting hardware trojans without requiring golden reference chips, using backscattering side channel analysis combined with clustering techniques. The method addresses a critical challenge in hardware security by enabling trojan detection in scenarios where trusted reference devices are unavailable.

The recognition at HOST 2020 validates the significance of this research in advancing hardware security methodologies. This work was conducted in collaboration with my colleagues Baki Berkay Yilmaz, Prof. Milos Prvulovic, and Prof. Alenka Zajic at Georgia Tech.
