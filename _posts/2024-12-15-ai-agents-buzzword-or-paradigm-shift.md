"AI agent"â€”a fancy buzzword for AI model integration, or is there more to it? With increasing autonomy and decision-making capabilities, are we just rebranding models, or is this a true paradigm shift?

As someone working on bringing generative AI to automotive experiences, I've been thinking about what truly distinguishes an "AI agent" from traditional AI models. The key seems to lie in autonomy, contextual awareness, and the ability to take actions rather than just provide responses.

While the term might be overused in marketing, the underlying capabilities represent genuine advances in AI systems that can:
- Maintain context across interactions
- Make decisions with minimal human intervention  
- Integrate with external systems and APIs
- Learn and adapt from their environment

The question isn't whether "AI agents" are just rebranded models, but whether we're witnessing the emergence of more sophisticated AI systems that blur the line between tools and autonomous entities.

What's your take? Are we seeing a fundamental shift in AI capabilities, or just clever marketing of existing technology?
